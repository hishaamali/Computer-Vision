This project has three parts:
Part 1: Computes a histogram. The histogram of an image is the statistic
counting of pixel values in the input image, where hist[i] tells how many
pixels having value i in the input image.
Part 2: Perform binary threshold operation on the input image using the
threshold values provide by the user via argv. The binary threshold operation
is the simplest way to extract foreground objects in a given grey-scale image.
Given an image and a threshold value, the binary threshold operation is to
transform pixels in the input image from grey-scale to binary values.
Part 3: Displays the result of threshold image in a nice visually.
